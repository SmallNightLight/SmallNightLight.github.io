            <h1>Toon Engine</h1>
            <p>I created a Toon Render Engine and submitted it to be published on the unity asset store!</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Toon shading with custom lighting</li>
                <li>Outlines</li>
                <li>Line hatching</li>
                <li>Benday-dots bloom effect</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Toon shading with custom lighting</h2>
            <img src="Images/ToonEngine4.png">
            <br>
            <p>This toon shading is achieved with a ToonShader written in shadergraph and highly customizable. Objects with this shader can receive lighting which is renderer based on a Toon ramp.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h2>Outlines</h2>
            <img src="Images/ToonEngine6.png">
            <br>
            <p>The outlines are applied as a fullscreen render feature. They are normal and depth based.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Line hatching</h2>
            <img src="Images/ToonEngine5.png">
            <br>
            <p>This line hatching style style works great for games with a comic book style like Hi-Fi Rush. It uses the unity built in ambient occlusion and is directly added inside the toon shader. The lines are procedurally generated, allowing for great customizability</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Benday-dots bloom effect</h2>
            <img src="Images/ToonEngine8.png">
            <br>
            <p>This bloom effect is also procedurally generated and uses a custom render feature. It first samples the bloom from the unity bloom shader and then passes the result to a composite shader which creates the ben-day dots bloom effect.</p>
