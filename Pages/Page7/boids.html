            <h1>Boid Simulation with Custom ECS</h1>
            <p>Recently, I've been working on an Entity Component System (ECS) for my minor. A boid simulation was the perfect choice to test its functionality.</p>
            <p>I also developed a custom spatial partition grid to optimize the boid interactions. With these optimizations, I achieved a performance of 1600 FPS while simulating 2000 boids.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is a preview:</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The physics calculations currently run on a single thread. In the future I might look into making it multi-threaded. The functionality for this is already present as I resolve the boids in in pairs.</p>
