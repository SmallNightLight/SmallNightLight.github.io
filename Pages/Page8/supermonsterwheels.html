            <p>This game was created in 2 months in a team of 6 people. The team consisted out of 2 artists, 3 designers and 1 engineer (me). It was made in the unity game engine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The theme of the game was "Monsters". We received 4 drawings with monsters from a local school that we needed to implement in a playable game.</p>
            <p>We made a chaotic driving game, featuring these monsters and using wii motes (with steering wheel) as input device</p>
            <br>
            <P> I was responsible for: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating the toon rendering style <a href= "../Page6/ToonEngine.html">(More info)</a></li>
                <li>Creating a tooling pipeline for the designers (spline roads)</li>
                <li>AI enemies</li>
                <li>Handling local multiplayer</li>
                <li>Custom input (Wii motes)</li>

                <li>...</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The project received the highest possible grade (10)</p>
